DOCUMENTATION
This language is written just to make you and me suffer. Use this at your own risk
Codes are written in-between two (```).



1. Variables
-must be declared at the start of the code. Use this(between two ```) as template:
```
	KAMUS
	Var1 : dataType1
	Var2 : dataType2
	.
	.
	.

	ALGORITMA
```
-make sure to NOT USE the variables, outside of what has been declared. 


2. INPUT/OUTPUT:
-INPUT:
```
	-> Var
```
-OUTPUT:
```
	<- Var
```


3. Assignment
```
	targetVar <- Var1
```
-This will copy the value of var1 into targetVar. You can also add operators like shown in the code below: 
```
	targetVar <- Var1 + Var2 - Var3
```


4. Conditional 
```
	if (cond.) then
		//trueCode
	else
		//falseCode
```
-cond. is condition, must results in Boolean
-trueCode and falseCode is lines of codes. Don't forget the indentation


5. Looping
-for loop
```
	i traversal [Start..End]:
		//code
```
-Start and End is integer, looping from Start to End, both inclusive.

-whileDo
```
	while (cond.) do:
		//code
```

-doWhile
```
	do:
		//code
	while (cond.)
```

-repeatUntil
```
	repeat:
		//code
	until (cond.)
```
